MOATA ALARM LABEL ANALYSIS REPORT (ANTI-BIAS)
================================================

This report presents evidence AND multiple plausible interpretations.
It avoids assuming a single intent behind labels without outcome data.

STEP 0 — DATA COVERAGE
----------------------
Total threshold rows analysed       : 926
Unique threshold IDs               : 926
Unique gauges with thresholds      : 151
Total gauges in asset inventory     : 264
Gauges without thresholds (inferred): 113 (42.8%)

STEP 1 — OBSERVED LABEL PATTERNS (FACTS)
-------------------------------------
severity×isCritical counts:
isCritical     False  True 
severity_norm              
High             149      0
Low              140      0
Medium           490    147

High severity AND Critical simultaneously: 0 rows.

STEP 2 — OPTIONAL CONSISTENCY CHECK (thresholds_test_results.json)
---------------------------------------------------------------
thresholds_test_results.json not found — skipped.

STEP 3 — MULTIPLE INTERPRETATIONS (ANTI-BIAS ASSESSMENT)
----------------------------------------------------------
Legend:
  SUPPORTED        : Strongly consistent with observed statistics
  WEAKLY SUPPORTED : Some support, but plausible counter-explanations remain
  INCONCLUSIVE     : Not enough information to decide
  NOT SUPPORTED    : Contradicted or not aligned with observed statistics

H1 (Primary): Severity ≈ event magnitude/rarity; isCritical ≈ operational urgency/fast-response
Status: SUPPORTED
Evidence:
  - severity×isCritical table:
    isCritical     False  True 
    severity_norm              
    High             149      0
    Low              140      0
    Medium           490    147
  - High & Critical rows: 0 out of 926 thresholds.
  - Share of High severity thresholds that are ARI-related: 1.000 (100.0%).
  - Top critical threshold_name: '2.5 mm' covering 0.973 (97.3%) of critical thresholds.
  - Median window_s: critical=30s vs non-critical=6.0hr.
  - Median resolution_s: critical=30s vs non-critical=5.0min.
  - Critical thresholds ARI-related share: 0.020 (2.0%).
  - Window ratio (critical/non-critical) ≈ 0.0014.
  - Resolution ratio (critical/non-critical) ≈ 0.1000.
  - High&Critical rate among High severity = 0.0000.

H2 (Alternative): isCritical ≈ data-quality/high-frequency trustworthiness trigger
Status: WEAKLY SUPPORTED
Evidence:
  - Critical median resolution is much smaller than non-critical (ratio ≈ 0.1000).
  - Critical median window is much smaller than non-critical (ratio ≈ 0.0014).
  - Top critical threshold_name share: 0.973 (97.3%).
  - High concentration suggests criticality may be a specific operational policy (not a general data-quality label).

H3 (Alternative): Severity labels are mostly a configuration/policy category (e.g., ARI thresholds set to High)
Status: SUPPORTED
Evidence:
  - High severity most common name: 'ARI Max Threshold' share=1.000 (100.0%).
  - High severity ARI-related share: 1.000 (100.0%).
  - No High severity thresholds are marked critical (supports separation/policy labelling).

H4 (Alternative): isCritical could reflect asset/site operational protection rather than human impact
Status: WEAKLY SUPPORTED
Evidence:
  - Critical thresholds occur across 147 unique gauges.
  - Spread ratio (critical gauges / all gauges-with-thresholds) = 0.974.
  - However, without incident/outcome metadata, distinguishing human-impact vs asset-protection intent remains uncertain.

FINAL — CAUTIOUS CONCLUSION
--------------------------
The dataset strongly constrains how labels are used:
- 'High' severity is tightly associated with ARI-related thresholds in this snapshot.
- 'Critical' is tightly associated with very short window/resolution thresholds (e.g., 30s).

However, label intent (human impact vs asset protection vs policy/legacy) cannot be fully proven
without outcome/incident metadata or official documentation of label definitions.
